# Study Guide Sample Webpage

## Description

This webpage was developed for pre-course work to apply basic coding principles prior to bootcamp. Creating this webpage allows a novice to understand how to use Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each code base built off the other to form an aesthetic study guide describing key code functions. This exercise developed an understanding to create repositories in Github and have it communicate with personal computers. The process showed how a website is a composition of several types of code.
